# Ninja Jocker
In this React application, I've created a 'Ninja Joker' joke generator. The app uses React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage state and make an HTTP request to the 'JokeAPI' for fetching jokes.
This project is a great way to learn more about making HTTP requests in a React application and managing component state with hooks.
